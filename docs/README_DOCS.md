## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation locally, you first need to install Python and Sphinx. Here are the steps to build the documentation:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the Python dependencies required for building the documentation:

```bash
# Execute in the project root directory
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Build HTML Documentation

#### On Linux/Mac Systems:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

Or use the provided simplified script:

```bash
cd docs
chmod +x build_docs.sh
./build_docs.sh
```

#### On Windows Systems:

```batch
cd docs
make.bat html
```

### 3. View Documentation

After building is complete, you can find the generated HTML documentation in the `docs/_build/html` directory. Open the `index.html` file with a browser to view the complete documentation.

## Building Documentation in Other Formats

In addition to HTML format, you can also build documentation in other formats:

### PDF Format

```bash
# Linux/Mac
cd docs
make latexpdf

# Windows
cd docs
make.bat latexpdf
```

Note: Building PDF documentation requires installing a LaTeX distribution (such as TeX Live, MiKTeX, etc.).

### EPUB Format

```bash
# Linux/Mac
cd docs
make epub

# Windows
cd docs
make.bat epub
```
